# Parenthetic Blog

A blog, well mostly code, about some random topics.
The entries are organized as different branches, and are ment as snippets to be copied only.
Do not look at it as a library, application or software with support.
I will not guarantee any good practice about git and keeping a clean and correct history.
So if something goes wrong, just remove your local copy and make a clean checkout.

If you have questions, please address them to the authors of the original software or the appropriate mailing lists.
So some places to ask questions, contribute, post issues, or discuss are:
